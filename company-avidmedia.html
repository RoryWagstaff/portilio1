		<h4>Avid Media: A Unique Global Native Content Service </h4>

		<h4> Launched in Covent Garden in 2010 </h4>

	<div class="text">
		<p> The growth of the digital economy has created many opportunities to find audiences across digital touchpoints, but also increased expectations from consumers of the relationship with brands. Many consumer groups see too much digital advertising as irrelevant or easy to ignore, which is reflected in low and declining engagement rates, and thus a lack of impact.
		</p>
		
		<p> 
		We believe that content that is native to the environment in which it appears is particularly effective. The key to success is matching the right content to the right person at the right moment and in the right environment.
